# CodeQuiz
As a novice coder, I want to create a challenging quiz that tests other coders, so that I can compare their scores against mine.

Purpose: To create an interactive quiz that tests your knowledge of coding and allows you to compare your score with your peers. You have only 30 seconds to complete the quiz. If you get a question wrong, 10 seconds will be deducted from your time. 

Obstacles: I found it difficult to create a code that allows me to store all of the highscores, even after refreshing the page. I also was challenged by the timer function, specifically deducting 10 points for a wrong answer.

Lessons Learned: I learned how to create wrong answers and how to connect those wrong answers to the timer. I also learned how to hide different elements at different times.
